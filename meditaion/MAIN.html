            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Mindfulness meditation originates from Buddhist teachings and is the
                most
                popular and researched form of meditation in the West.

                In mindfulness meditation, you pay attention to your thoughts as they pass through your mind. You don’t
                judge the thoughts or become involved with them. You simply observe and take note of any patterns.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">2-SPRITUAL MEDITATION</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Spiritual meditation is used in nearly all religions and spiritual
                traditions.

                The types of spiritual meditation are as diverse as the world’s spiritual traditions themselves. Many of
                the
                meditation techniques listed in this article could be considered spiritual meditation.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">3-FOCUSED MEDITATION</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Focused meditation involves concentration using any of the five senses.

                For example, you can focus on something internal, like your breath, or you can bring in external
                influences
                to help focus your attention.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">4-MOVEMENT MEDITATION</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">This is an active form of meditation where the movement guides you into
                a
                deeper connection with your body and the present moment.

                Movement meditation is good for people who find peace in action and want to develop body awareness.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Mantra meditation is prominent in many teachings, including Hindu and
                Buddhist
                traditions. This type of meditation uses a repetitive sound to clear the mind. It can be a word, phrase,
                or
                sound, one of the most common being “om.”

                Your mantra can be spoken loudly or quietly. After chanting the mantra for some time, you’ll be more
                alert and
                in tune with your environment. This allows you to experience deeper levels of awareness.
