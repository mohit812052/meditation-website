    <p>It seems like we can’t go anywhere on the Internet these days without running into a story about the benefits of meditation. 
        And it’s 100% true—studies show that meditation can decrease stress, increase focus, and even provide relief for suffers of chronic pain and 
        illness. But the fact remains that meditation isn’t easy, especially for those of us who struggle to turn off the mental chatter and the buzz of 
        thoughts of work, bills, family, and all the other stresses of modern day life.</p>
        <p>That buzzing is exactly why we need meditation now more than ever. With our busy lives and the often welcome (yet unfulfilling) distractions
             technology provides, it’s important to make time to simply sit with your thoughts. If you’re new to meditation and you don’t know
             where to start, this free 30 Day Yoga Challenge will ease you in slowly. Plus, you’ll get into a steady daily routine!</p>
